&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this technological world websites are the most important area with which a person can access any information any 
time anywhere. Nowadays website can be accessible from any mobile device that is, smart phones, tablets and laptops and to make the website work on all these devices
it should be designed in such a way that its content does not get affected when used in different size of display. The term mobile responsive means the working of
a website perfectly in any resolution. Also, in IT world making mobile responsive website means, using only the HTML and CSS syntax in the website design, it means
no use of any programming language and javascript. Nowadays mobile responsive websites are in great demand. The responsive design code consists of flexible
layouts and the images can be resizable. The code contains a CSS queries which makes the website mobile responsive (Smashing team, 2011). Responsive web designs
are related to web technologies because they help the web technologies to become more user friendly.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there is an advantage of using mobile responsive code to build a website. It helps to decrease the loading speed of the webpage because the webpage is now able to work in any screen resolution, also the user can
easily navigate the webpage (Arsenault, 2017).In building this mobile responsive website I have used meta name that contains the viewport that describes the
visible area to the user. In the CSS file I have used the @media only screen that enables the screen to fit into any screen resolution under the size of
specified max-width. I have learned that building a web apps for different devices helps to increase the sale of the website as it makes the user interface
better and compatible with any devices having different screen resolutions. I have also learned that webpages having mobile responsive code takes very low
time to load and managing such websites are easy and cost effective.
